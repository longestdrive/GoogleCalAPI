GoogleCalAPI for Laravel 4.1
============
This API is work in progress - something I needed for a site I was working on. It's based on a similar api on analytics (thujogn/analytics). Documentation is currently poor.

It only has very basic features which i'll add to over time

Feel free to fork etc

Install using composer and then publish the config file. Update the config file with your google credentials

Place your p12 certificate in the config folder and change the keys to your set up
